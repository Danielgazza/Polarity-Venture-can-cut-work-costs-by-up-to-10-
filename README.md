Polarity Venture can cut work costs by up to 10%, through interdepartmental collaborations.

Consumers were promised a new investment package by the end of April 2021, but they did not receive it until the end of June, which is an additional two months, and even then, consumers experienced errors in processing packages, making it difficult to understand what the packages were and stood for.

The Analytic term formulated questions to aid in the development of data-driven steps HR can use to improve interdepartmental collaboration; ineffective collaboration was identified as the root cause of the problem. Which departments are the most active/least active? According to our findings, sales, operations, and administration were the most active, while IT, engineering, and marketing were the least active. I went on to ask, "Which employees have the most connections?" Employee 605 from the Sales department.

The goal of this analysis is to develop data-driven steps that HR can use, which leads to the questions, "Identify the most influential departments and employees?" Our most influential departments are also the most active.
